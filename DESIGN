  goals:
    rule based
    compositional with reusable small components
    intuitive and easy to use
    simple and efficient operational semantics and implementation (should be easy to imagine the compilation/codegen)

  events:
    collision between entities and client

actor is alias to entity

question:
  how to organize actor state modifier?
    #1 keep it together and use some mechanism to allow a state change what also depends on other actors's state (transactional)

    #2 scatter the rules and allow actors to modify each others

  choice: #1

two universes:
  game world    - entities can interact   (step + interaction)
  visual world  - visuals are independent (only step, no interaction)


question:
  how to find target when teleporting?
    #1 use targetname as reference and lookup the target from the previous frame?

    #2 instead of references, teleports should contain the targets

    hint: what can happen to targets? who can modify them?


  how to do telefrag (killbox)? also how to do volume damage of a rocket impact?
    #1 damage box should be an entity, and it can change it's collision volume if necessary
        hint: this adds one frame delay
              however as a remedy we can introduce a new post interaction pass (e.g. damage pass)
      #1a presistent killbox
            this would be a single interaction between the player that enters the teleport and everybody in the killbox at that moment
            pro:  increases expressive power, clean solution
            cons: needs to support interaction between many elements, right now only interaction paris are supported

      #1b dynamic killbox
            killbox spawns on teleport, and also spawns the player at the new position
            pro:  already implemented
            cons: adds delay, player will be missing for one frame

    #2 we allow entity logic to modify other's state

idea:
  as a preformance optimization we should prefilter interactions with masking (bitmask for each entity type)
