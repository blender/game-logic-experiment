  goals:
    rule based
    compositional with reusable small components
    intuitive and easy to use
    simple and efficient operational semantics and implementation (should be easy to imagine the compilation/codegen)

  events:
    collision between entities and client

actor is alias to entity

question:
  how to organize actor state modifier?
    #1 keep it together and use some mechanism to allow a state change what also depends on other actors's state (transactional)

    #2 scatter the rules and allow actors to modify each others
